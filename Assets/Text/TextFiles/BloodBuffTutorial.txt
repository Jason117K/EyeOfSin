Certain SUMMONS have the ability to apply BLOOD BUFFS to other summons. This 
means that when a compatible summon is placed in the BLOOD BUFF area of
another SUMMON, a special interaction will occur, making the SUMMONS stronger.
 
Try out activating a BLOOD BUFF with an Occular Spine and an EggWyrm. Place the 
EggWyrm on the map. Take note of the squares surrounding the EggWyrm preview 
denoting what tiles it can apply a Blood Buff too.
